Hello, This is mikhail modesto.

This is my first time doing/using react native. 
before i start and received the email i have 0 knowledge about react or react native, i have gist about it but that's all.

The login credentials for the application is 
username = test (any cases)
password = 123456

Hopefully it works on your device (fingers crossed)

I used async storage for persistence since that was easier to implement, i've had a rough time playing with redux as i dont have time to read entire documentations.

OpenAI has been the biggest helper in learning new language allowing me to play around and analyze patterns and similarities in other language.
I tried to include the persistence of notes as ive done the same thing in my thesis application which is built on flutter with reliance on dependency.
I do apologize in advance if it does not meet your standard still i hope you give me a chance to learn and to become a part of your team.

I received the email around 9:51am it is now 1:22am thank you very much i've had so much fun doing this.
